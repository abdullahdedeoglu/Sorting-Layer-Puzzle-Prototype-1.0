## Sorting-Layer-Puzzle-Prototype-1.0
One of the puzzle prototype of Painted Hearts mechanics

# Overview

This repository contains a mechanic prototype for a Unity game. The prototype demonstrates a layer sorting mechanic where players must arrange layers in the correct order to progress.

# Features

- **DragController:** Handles the dragging behavior for UI elements vertically. Allows players to drag and reorder layers.
- **Layer:** Manages individual layers in the game. Determines if a layer is in the correct order and adjusts the sorting order of important items accordingly.
- **LayerManager:** Manages the overall state of layers in the game. Checks if all layers are in the correct order and displays a "You Passed" message if so.
- **LayerScriptableObject:** ScriptableObject containing data for individual layers, including their order index and the name of important items associated with each layer.

# How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Explore the scripts and game objects to understand how the layer sorting mechanic works.
4. Playtest the prototype to experience the mechanic in action.
5. Make modifications or integrate the mechanic into your own Unity project as needed.

# Notes

- This prototype is still in its primitive stage and may require further development to be fully functional in a game.
- Feel free to expand upon or customize the mechanic to suit your game's specific requirements.
